# Color-Game
This is a color game that was being created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The colors are basically in the form of rgba. There are two modes of operation:
1. Easy mode: The user would be dealing with 3 colors in this mode. 
2. Hard mode: The user would be dealing with 6 colors in this mode. 
There is an option of "New Colors" as well where user can change the color pattern if he/she doesn't like it. 
If the user gave the wrong input in that case the output generated would be "Try Again" and if the user gives the right input in that case the output would be "Correct" and the color pattern would change to the correct color.
